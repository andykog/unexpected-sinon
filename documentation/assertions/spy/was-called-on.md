Passes if the spy was ever called with obj as its `this` value.

```js
var obj = { spy: sinon.spy() };
obj.spy();
expect(obj.spy, 'was called on', obj);
```

In case of a failing expectation you get the following output:

```js
var another = {};
expect(obj.spy, 'was called on', another);
```

```output
expected spy was called on {}
  expected invocations( spy() ) to have values satisfying 'was called on', {}

  spyCalls[
    spy() // expected spy() was called on {}
          //   expected spy to be called with {} as this but was called with { spy: spy }
  ]
```

You can make this assertion more strict by using the `always`
flag. Then it passes if the spy was always called with obj as its this
value.

```js
expect(obj.spy, 'was always called on', obj);
```

In case of a failing expectation you get the following output:

```js
obj.spy.call({});
expect(obj.spy, 'was always called on', obj);
```

```output
expected spy was always called on { spy: spy }
  expected invocations( spy(), spy() ) to have values satisfying 'was called on', { spy: spy }

  spyCalls[
    spy(),
    spy() // expected spy() was called on { spy: spy }
          //   expected spy to be called with { spy: spy } as this but was called with {}
  ]
```
